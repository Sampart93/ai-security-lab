# AI Security Lab

This repository documents my structured 4-week intensive training program focused on:

- Networking Fundamentals
- Linux System Security
- Web Application Penetration Testing
- AI / LLM Red Teaming

The goal is to develop practical, hands-on offensive security skills with a specialization in AI system vulnerabilities.

All work is performed in controlled lab environments.
