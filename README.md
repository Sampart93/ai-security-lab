# AI Security Lab

This repository documents my structured, hands-on training focused on becoming an AI-Focused Penetration Tester.

The objective is to develop practical offensive security skills across:

- Networking & System Fundamentals
- Linux Security & Misconfiguration Analysis
- Web Application Penetration Testing (OWASP Top 10)
- AI / LLM Red Teaming (Prompt Injection, RAG Attacks, Tool Abuse)

All work is conducted in controlled lab environments.

## Focus Areas

### 1. Web Application Security
- HTTP interception and manipulation
- Authentication & session analysis
- Injection vulnerabilities
- Access control flaws (IDOR, privilege escalation)
- Vulnerability reporting & mitigation strategies

### 2. AI / LLM Security
- Prompt injection mechanics
- Indirect prompt injection
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) attack surfaces
- System prompt leakage
- Tool-calling abuse
- Defensive guardrail evaluation

---

## Methodology

For each topic:
- Build a controlled lab
- Identify attack surfaces
- Exploit vulnerabilities
- Document impact
- Propose mitigation

---

## Outcome Goal

To demonstrate:
- Systems-level thinking
- Offensive security methodology
- AI-specific vulnerability awareness
- Clear technical communication

---

This repository evolves as practical labs and reports are completed.
