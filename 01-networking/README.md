# Networking Fundamentals

Started: 28 Feb 2026

I’m going back to basics here.

Before moving deeper into web security and AI systems, I want to properly understand what’s happening underneath everything.

This section is me breaking down:

- how devices actually talk to each other  
- what really happens when you load a website  
- how TCP connections get established  
- how DNS works  
- and where things could go wrong from a security point of view  

I’ve written separate notes for specific parts:

- dns-resolution.md  
- tcp-handshake.md  
- command-line-tests.md  

The idea isn’t to memorise the OSI model like an exam.

It’s to actually understand:

When I type https://google.com into a browser… what technically happens step by step?

And more importantly:

Where could that process be manipulated?

I’m trying to think about networking less as “infrastructure” and more as a chain of trust.

If something in that chain breaks, what happens?

That’s the mindset I’m building here.
